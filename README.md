**Comprehensive Analysis of Bank Loan Data for Loan Performance and Credit Risk Assessment
**
This project leverages Power BI to perform an in-depth analysis of bank loan data. Key aspects include:

Key Metrics Calculation: Tracking month-over-month (MoM) growth and month-to-date (MTD) performance.
Loan Characteristic Analysis: Examining loan metrics by geography, loan tenure, and borrower career experience to identify primary loan purposes and gain insights into borrower profiles and loan distribution patterns.
NPA and Good Loan Metrics: Evaluating metrics for good loans and Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) to assess the quality of the loan portfolio and credit risk.
Interactive Filtering: Utilizing dynamic slicers for flexible and detailed data exploration.

This analysis aids in understanding loan performance and credit risk, providing valuable insights for better decision-making.
